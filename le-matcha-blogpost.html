            <h2>Le Matcha Review: Tasting Samples at Rice Market</h2>
            <p>I have been seeing this matcha brand, Le Matcha, on Instagram lately, but didn’t know much about them. The last time I tried a popular fancy matcha brand from Instagram, I was actually disappointed, so my hopes for Le Matcha were not that high.</p>
            <p>A friend of mine sent me an Instagram post about Le Matcha doing a popup in Rice Market. I love Rice Market, happened to be off of work that day, and had a friend going, so I said I was down to go despite not having high hopes for the matcha itself.</p>
            <h3>Matcha Sampling (and Hojicha!)</h3>
            <p>I arrived early, but I was impatient so I headed into Rice Market, knowing I’d be back later to meet Genevieve. To my surprise, there was no line! To my second surprise, the samples were completely free! They were offering two matchas as well as a hojicha to sample. It goes without saying, I tried everything.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Samidori Matcha: as a tea, prepared with just water</li>
              <li>Okumidori Matcha: as an iced latte</li>
              <li>Hojicha: as an iced latte, topped with black sesame cold foam</li>
            </ol>
            <p>All three of the teas are single origin, sourced from Uji, Japan. There were also some treats for sale as well :)</p>
